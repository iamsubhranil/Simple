How do i know if a variable is a constant?
A variable is constant if it is declared in the present scope,
and is currently assigned to a constant (assignment statements are important).
A variable will be considered being assigned to a constant if
1. It is assigned to a number/boolean
2. It is assigned to a constant expression

If we want to optimize after completing parsing the whole source, which seems
to be the natural choice, then we have to maintain a dictionary containing
the state of the variable at various lines in the source file.

We can't really tell whether a variable declared in an outer scope
is constant or not.
